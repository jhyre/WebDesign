<p>Mr. Winkler, a so-so cook and a champion eater, was spending a July afternoon at Lucali in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, learning to make pizza. He’d been rolling out a blob of springy fridge-chilled dough using a full wine bottle. (“You the roll the dough, you take a sip,” Mark Iacono, Lucali’s stubbled owner said.)
The shape that flopped on the marble work top wasn’t quite a circle. It looked more like the state of Texas, Mr. Iacono observed.
“Is that good?” Mr. Winkler said.</p>

<p>Mr. Iacono paused. “Yeah,” he said. He paused again. “As long as you have fun doing it.”
Mr. Winkler, 72, was having fun. A lot of it. So much that one of his pies burned while he was basking in the moment. That was fun, too.After a stint at the Yale School of Drama, he spent a decade as the Fonz, the huggable greaser of “Happy Days” fame, the man who actually jumped the shark. But when that series finished, Mr. Winkler’s career flagged. “I literally couldn’t get hired,” he said.</p>

<p>He can now. On Netflix’s “Arrested Development,” he plays Barry Zuckerkorn, arguably television’s worst lawyer. And he just notched an Emmy nomination, his sixth, for his supporting work as the minimally competent acting teacher Gene Cousineau on the HBO comedy “Barry.”“It took me this long to be close to the actor I knew I wanted to be,” Mr. Winkler said.
Earlier that afternoon, he had arrived late to his private pizza lesson. Blame fun. While his wife, Stacey Winkler, waited at Lucali, Mr. Winkler tagged along with Mr. Iacono on a trip to the pork store and then insisted on stopping into every bakery they passed, snapping smartphone pictures along the way.</p>

<p>Then it was Mr. Winkler’s turn. “Work from the center out,” Mr. Iacono said. “Just keep going, going, going.” Mr. Winkler kept at it, while Mr. Iacono gathered some logs to stoke the oven.“Are you sweating?” Mr. Iacono asked.“Me?” Mr. Winkler said. “No. I’m enjoying.” That Fonzie cool is lasting.“Wait till I open the oven,” Mr. Iacono said.</p>

<p>He showed Mr. Winkler how to stretch his dough further, resting it on Mr. Winkler’s upstretched thumbs. “You’ve got those famous thumbs,” Mr. Iacono said. Ayyy! With the dough properly rolled, Mr. Winkler ladled on some sauce. He piled cheese on top, and then some more. He grated a small mound for himself, too. “I’m just going to test this,” he said. Then he tested it again.
Mr. Iacono helped him put his pizza in the oven, jiggling it off a wooden paddle. “Nice and easy,” he said.</p>

<p>When the pie emerged about three minutes later, still bubbling, Mr. Iacono snipped fresh basil onto it, then sprinkled on Parmesan. Ms. Winkler took a slice and fed her husband a few bites as he worked on the next one. “Oh my God,” he said. Ms. Winkler, who knows him well, asked if he’d added extra cheese. Under Mr. Iacono’s tutelage, Mr. Winkler’s pizzas grew progressively rounder (and progressively cheesier). He patiently imparted some of his newfound wisdom to his wife as she struggled with a ball of dough. “Put your palm here,” he said. “That’s it. Now push out.” The will to watch growth.</p>

<p>After a lunch of pizza and Mr. Iacono’s meatballs, Mr. Winkler slipped into the back garden for a decaf espresso. Mr. Iacono brought out a pile of grapes, so purple they were nearly black, and a small plate of watermelon that Mr. Winkler ate as juice soaked his chin. Ms. Winkler tried to convince him to stop at a nearby bakery for an Italian ice, but Mr. Winkler had finally had enough fun. “Like a camel, I’m not eating again until August,” he said.</p>
